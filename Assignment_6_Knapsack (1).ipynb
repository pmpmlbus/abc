    "# Code Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Algorithm Overview:\n",
    "#    - This is a recursive implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem\n",
    "#    - For each item, we have two choices: include it or exclude it\n",
    "#    - Goal is to maximize value while keeping total weight under capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Parameters:\n",
    "#    - W: Maximum weight capacity of knapsack\n",
    "#    - wt: Array of item weights\n",
    "#    - val: Array of item values (profits)\n",
    "#    - n: Number of items\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Base Cases:\n",
    "#    - If no items left (n == 0)\n",
    "#    - If no capacity left (W == 0)\n",
    "#    - Return 0 in both cases\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Recursive Cases:\n",
    "#    - If current item's weight > remaining capacity:\n",
    "#      - Skip item, move to next\n",
    "#    - Otherwise, take maximum of:\n",
    "#      - Include current item: val[n-1] + recursive call with reduced capacity\n",
    "#      - Exclude current item: recursive call without current item\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Time Complexity: O(2ⁿ)\n",
    "#    - For each item, we make 2 recursive calls\n",
    "#    - Decision tree has height n\n",
    "#    - Total nodes = 2⁰ + 2¹ + 2² + ... + 2ⁿ\n",
    "#    - This forms a geometric series summing to O(2ⁿ)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Space Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "#    - Maximum depth of recursion tree is n\n",
    "#    - Each recursive call uses constant space\n",
    "#    - Total stack space is proportional to depth\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Usage:\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "# Enter the number of items: 3\n",
    "# Enter the values (profits) of the items separated by commas: 60,100,120\n",
    "# Enter the weights of the items separated by commas: 10,20,30\n",
    "# Enter the capacity of the knapsack: 50\n",
    "# The maximum profit is: 220\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Performance Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Advantages:\n",
    "#    - Simple to understand and implement\n",
    "#    - Works well for small inputs\n",
    "#    - Gives optimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Limitations:\n",
    "#    - Exponential time complexity\n",
    "#    - Not suitable for large inputs\n",
    "#    - Redundant calculations (same subproblems solved multiple times)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Improvements Possible:\n",
    "#    - Dynamic Programming version: O(nW) time complexity\n",
    "#    - Memoization to avoid redundant calculations\n",
    "#    - Iterative version to avoid stack overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "# Common Edge Cases:\n",
    "# 1. Empty input (n = 0)\n",
    "# 2. Single item\n",
    "# 3. All items too heavy\n",
    "# 4. Exact capacity match\n",
    "# 5. Large numbers causing integer overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexity: O(2N)\n",
    "# Auxiliary Space: O(N)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Branch and bound\n",
    "# Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or show how to implement any of the suggested improvements?"
