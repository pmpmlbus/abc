    "# # Let me explain how this code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 1. **Problem Overview**:\n",
    "# #    - The code solves the Club Assignment Problem where N students need to be assigned to N clubs\n",
    "# #    - Each assignment has a cost, and we need to find the minimum total cost assignment\n",
    "# #    - Each student must be assigned to exactly one club, and each club must have exactly one student\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 2. **Key Components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# #    a) `Node` class:\n",
    "# #    - Represents a state in the search tree\n",
    "# #    - Tracks which student is assigned to which club\n",
    "# #    - Maintains the current assignments and costs\n",
    "# #    - Links to parent node for backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "# #    b) `CustomHeap` class:\n",
    "# #    - Implements a priority queue using Python's heapq\n",
    "# #    - Used to always process the most promising assignment next\n",
    "# #    - Stores nodes ordered by their total cost\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 3. **Main Functions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# #    a) `calculate_cost()`:\n",
    "# #    - Estimates the minimum possible cost to assign remaining students\n",
    "# #    - Uses a greedy approach for the heuristic\n",
    "# #    - Essential for A* search to work efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "# #    b) `find_min_cost()`:\n",
    "# #    - Implements the A* search algorithm\n",
    "# #    - Explores possible assignments starting from no assignments\n",
    "# #    - Uses priority queue to always explore most promising path first\n",
    "# #    - Returns when all students are assigned\n",
    "\n",
    "# #    c) `print_assignments()`:\n",
    "# #    - Recursively prints the final assignments\n",
    "# #    - Traverses from leaf node back to root using parent pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 4. **Algorithm Flow**:\n",
    "# #    1. Start with empty assignments\n",
    "# #    2. For each student:\n",
    "# #       - Try assigning them to each available club\n",
    "# #       - Calculate actual cost plus estimated future cost\n",
    "# #       - Add these possibilities to priority queue\n",
    "# #    3. Always explore the lowest cost option next\n",
    "# #    4. Continue until all students are assigned\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 5. **Input/Output**:\n",
    "# #    - Takes number of students/clubs (N)\n",
    "# #    - Takes NxN cost matrix\n",
    "# #    - Outputs optimal assignments and total cost\n",
    "\n",
    "# # The code uses A* search with an admissible heuristic to guarantee finding the optimal solution while typically exploring fewer possibilities than brute force would require.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let me analyze the time complexity and provide edge case examples for this Club Assignment Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "# 1. Main Operation: Branch and Bound with Priority Queue\n",
    "# 2. For each student (N), we try each unassigned club as a possibility\n",
    "# 3. At each node:\n",
    "#    - Calculating minimum cost for remaining assignments: O(N²)\n",
    "#    - Priority queue operations: O(log M) where M is queue size\n",
    "#    - Queue can contain up to O(N!) nodes in worst case\n",
    "# 4. Overall time complexity: O(N! * N² * log(N!))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Space Complexity:\n",
    "# - Priority queue can store up to O(N!) nodes\n",
    "# - Each node stores an assignment array of size N\n",
    "# - Space Complexity: O(N! * N)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Edge Cases:\n",

    "# 1. All Equal Costs:\n",

    "# 1 1 1\n",
    "# 1 1 1\n",
    "# 1 1 1\n",

    "# - Challenge: Multiple optimal solutions exist\n",

    "# ```\n",
    "# - Challenge: Obvious optimal solution but requires looking ahead\n",
    "# - Tests if algorithm avoids local minima\n",
    "# - Any wrong assignment leads to very high costs\n",

    "# - Challenge: Tests if algorithm can find global optimum\n",
    "# - Greedy approach would fail\n",
    "# - Requires proper evaluation of future costs\n",

    "# 5. Single Good Path:\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "# 100  100    1\n",
    "# 100    1  100\n",
    "#   1  100  100\n",

    "# - Challenge: Only one optimal solution exists\n",
    "# - Tests algorithm's ability to find the single best path\n",
    "# - Any deviation leads to significantly worse results\n",

    "# Common Issues to Consider:\n",
    "# 1. Numerical overflow with large costs\n",
    "# 2. Precision issues with floating-point calculations\n",
    "# 3. Memory constraints with large N due to factorial growth\n",
    "# 4. Performance degradation with increasing problem size\n",
    "# 5. Handling of negative costs if allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "# The algorithm performs best with:\n",
    "# - Small to medium-sized problems (N ≤ 10)\n",
    "# - Well-distributed costs\n",
    "# - Clear cost differentials between good and bad assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "# It performs worst with:\n",
    "# - Large number of students/clubs (N > 10)\n",
    "# - Many similar or equal costs\n",
    "# - Highly skewed cost distributions requiring extensive backtracking\n",
