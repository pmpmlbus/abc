    "# Let me explain the code and its important aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Algorithm Explanation:\n",
    "# - The Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph\n",
    "# - It can handle negative edge weights (unlike Dijkstra's algorithm)\n",
    "# - It can detect negative cycles in the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Key Components:\n",
    "# - `__init__`: Initializes the graph with number of vertices\n",
    "# - `add_edge`: Adds edges to the graph with their weights\n",
    "# - `Bellman`: Implements the main Bellman-Ford algorithm\n",
    "# - `printArr`: Prints the final distances\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Time Complexity:\n",
    "# - Time Complexity: O(V Ã— E) where V is number of vertices and E is number of edges\n",
    "# - Space Complexity: O(V) for the distance array\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Edge Cases and Special Conditions:\n",
    "# - Negative edge weights: Handled correctly\n",
    "# - Negative cycles: Detected and reported\n",
    "# - Disconnected vertices: Will show infinity as distance\n",
    "# - Empty graph: Will work correctly\n",
    "# - Single vertex: Will work correctly\n",
    "# - All edges negative: Will work correctly as long as no negative cycles exist\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Important Features:\n",
    "# - Can detect negative weight cycles\n",
    "# - Handles directed graphs\n",
    "# - Can work with both positive and negative edge weights\n",
    "# - Returns shortest paths from source to all vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Example Usage:\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# # Create a graph with 4 vertices\n",
    "# g = Bellman_Ford(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Add edges (u, v, w)\n",
    "# g.add_edge(0, 1, 5)\n",
    "# g.add_edge(0, 2, 4)\n",
    "# g.add_edge(1, 3, 3)\n",
    "# g.add_edge(2, 1, -6)\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Run algorithm from source vertex 0\n",
    "# g.Bellman(0)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Limitations:\n",
    "# - Cannot handle undirected negative edges effectively (should be converted to directed edges)\n",
    "# - Performance is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for non-negative weights\n",
    "# - Requires all vertices to be numbered from 0 to V-1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or provide example test cases?"
