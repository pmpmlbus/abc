    "\n",
    "# 2. **Key Components**:\n",
    "#    - `Node` class: Represents a state in the assignment tree\n",
    "#    - `CustomHeap` class: Priority queue implementation for Branch and Bound\n",
    "#    - `calculate_cost`: Computes lower bound for remaining assignments\n",
    "#    - `find_min_cost`: Main function implementing Branch and Bound\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Time Complexity Analysis**:\n",
    "#    - Worst-case time complexity: O(N! * N²)\n",
    "#      - N! possible assignments in worst case\n",
    "#      - For each node: O(N²) for calculating lower bound\n",
    "#    - Space complexity: O(N! * N) for storing nodes in priority queue\n",
    "#    - Best-case time complexity: O(N²) when the first path leads to optimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Branch and Bound Strategy**:\n",
    "#    - Each node represents a partial assignment\n",
    "#    - Lower bound is calculated for unassigned workers\n",
    "#    - Priority queue ensures exploration of most promising assignments first\n",
    "#    - Pruning happens implicitly through the priority queue\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Optimizations Used**:\n",
    "#    - Greedy calculation of lower bound\n",
    "#    - Early termination when complete assignment is found\n",
    "#    - Efficient state tracking using boolean array\n",
    "\n",
